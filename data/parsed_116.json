Then he gawked, too.Instead of a standard trainee bunk of two small beds with drawers underneath them and totally bare walls, Vik\u2019s bunk was virtually covered with images of their friend Wyatt Enslow. There were posters all over the wall with Wyatt\u2019s solemn, oval face on them. She wore her customary scowl, her dark eyes tracking their every move through the bunk. There was\u00a0a giant\u00a0marble statue of a sad-looking Vik with a boot on top of its head. The Vik statue clutched two very, very tiny hands together in a gesture of supplication, its eyes trained upward on the unseen stomper, an inscription at its base, WHY, OH WHY, DID I CROSS WYATT ENSLOW?Tom began to laugh.\u201cShe didn\u2019t do it to the bunk,\u201d Vik insisted. \u201cShe must\u2019ve done something to our processors.\u201dThat much was obvious. If Wyatt was good at anything, it was pulling off tricks with the neural processors, which could pretty much be manipulated to show them anything. This was some sort of illusion she was making them see, and Tom heartily approved.He stepped closer to the walls to admire some of the photos\u00a0pinned there, freeze-frames of some of Vik\u2019s more embarrassing moments at the Spire: that time Vik got\u00a0a computer virus\u00a0that convinced him he was a sheep, and he\u2019d crawled around on his hands and knees chewing on plants in the arboretum. Another was Vik gaping in dismay as Wyatt won the war games.\u201cMy hands do not look like that.\u201d Vik jabbed a finger at the statue and its abnormally tiny hands. Wyatt had relentlessly mocked Vik for having small, delicate hands ever since Tom had informed her it was the proper way to counter one of Vik\u2019s nicknames for her, \u201cMan Hands.\u201d Vik had mostly\u00a0abandoned\u00a0that nickname for \u201cEvil Wench,\u201d and Tom suspected it was due to the delicate-hands gibe.Just then, Vik\u2019s new roommate bustled into the bunk.He was a tall, slim guy with curly black hair and a pointy look to his face.

The story goes that Raimon killed Guilhem while he was out hunting, removed the heart from the body, and had it served to his wife for dinner, cooked and seasoned with pepper. Then comes the great confrontation:\u201cAnd when the lady had eaten of it, RAimon de Castel-Roussillon said unto her: \u201cKnow you of what you have eaten?\u2019 And she said, \u2018I know not, save that the taste thereof is good and savoury.\u2019 Then he said to her that that she had eaten of was in very truth the head of SIr Guilhem of Cabestanh, and caused the head to be brought before her, that she might the more readily believe it. And when the lady had seen and heard this, she straightway fell into a swoon, and when she was recovered of it, she spake and said: \u201cOf a truth, my Lord, such good meat have you given me that never more will I eat of other.\u201dTHen he, hearing this, ran upon her with his sword and would have struck at her head, but the lady ran to a balcony, and cast herself down, and so died.\u201d...the story is probably apocryphal\u2026 grisly details...borrowed from an ancient legend...the Middle Ages believed it and drew the intended moral conclusion-that husbands should leave well enough alone.

Then she decided to study the inside of Paul\u2019s truck to see what she could learn about him.Technically, it was exactly like hers and Gentry\u2019s. It had a black exterior with a blue light bar across the top and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Enforcement Division logo on the doors.It was tech heavy on the front dash, just like theirs, with LDWF, Terrebonne Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, and Louisiana State Police Troop C radios, a laptop, a GPS unit, and a weather unit.In her truck and in Gentry\u2019s, the cords and wires were a colorful tangle of plastic and metal, usually with extra plugs dangling around like vines.

Paul had a 12-gauge shotgun and a .223 carbine mounted right behind the driver\u2019s seat, same as in her own truck. The mounts had hidden release buttons so the agents could get the guns out one-handed and quickly.But where her truck had a catch-all supply of stuff, from paper towels to zip ties to evidence bags to fast-food wrappers thrown in the back, Paul\u2019s backseat was empty but for a zippered storage container normal people used for shoes. Each space held different things, all neatly arranged. Jena spotted evidence bags in one. Zip ties in another. Notebooks. Citation books. Paperwork.

That had been such a chaotic, ridiculous job.\u201cAt least you\u2019ll have something to fall back on if you do fail,\u201d Lizzy teased.\u201cI seriously hope not.\u201d She set the two glasses on the bar and strained the purple concoction into them. With the twinkle lights strung up around the lanai and the ones glittering in the pool, the sugar seemed to sparkle around the rim. \u201cThis is called a wildcat.\u201d\u201cYou have to make me one of those too!\u201d The unfamiliar female voice made Athena look up.Her eyes widened as her gaze locked with Quinn freaking Brody, the too-sexy-man with an aversion to virgins. He was with the tall woman who\u2019d just asked Athena to make a drink. But she had eyes only for Quinn. Her heart about jumped out of her chest. What was he doing here of all places? At least he looked just as surprised to see her.She ignored him because she knew if she stared into those dark eyes she\u2019d lose the ability to speak and then she\u2019d inevitably embarrass herself.The tall, built-like-a-goddess woman with pale blonde hair he was with smiled widely at Athena. \u201cOnly if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she continued, nodding at the drinks. \u201cThey look so good.\u201d\u201cAh, you can have this one. I made an extra for the lush here.\u201d She tilted her head at Lizzy with a half-smile. Athena had planned to drink the second one herself but didn\u2019t trust her hands not to shake if she made another. She couldn\u2019t believe Quinn was standing right in front of her, looking all casual and annoyingly sexy in dark jeans and a long-sleeved sweater shoved up to his elbows. Why did his forearms have to look so good?\u201cHa, ha.\u201d Lizzy snagged her drink as Athena stepped out from behind the bar. \u201cAthena, this is Quinn Brody and Dominique Castle. They both work for Red Stone but Dominique is almost as new as you.\u201dForcing a smile on her face, Athena nodded politely at both of them\u2014and tried to ignore the way Quinn was staring at her. She\u2019d had no freaking idea he worked for Red Stone. He looked a bit like a hungry wolf. Just like on their last date\u2014two months ago. When he\u2019d decided she was too much trouble, being a virgin and all. Jackass. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you both.\u201d She did a mental fist pump when her voice sounded normal. \u201cI promised Belle I\u2019d help out inside but I hope to see you both around tonight.\u201d Liar, liar.\u201cMe too. Thanks again for the drink,\u201d Dominique said cheerfully while Lizzy just gave Athena a strange look.Athena wasn\u2019t sure what Quinn\u2019s expression was because she\u2019d decided to do the mature thing\u2014and studiously ignore him.", "author": "Katie Reus, Sworn to Protect", "tags": "romantic-suspense"}, {"quote": "Cuba changed you.

It circumscribes the person at some distance, and corresponds to those things in the world that deserve empathy. I like the term \"empathy\" because it has spiritual overtones. A term like \"sympathy\" or \"allegiance\" might be more precise, but I want the chosen term to be slightly mystical, to suggest that we might not be able to fully understand what goes on between us and others, that we should leave open the possibility that the relationship can't be represented in a digital database.If someone falls within your circle of empathy, you wouldn't want to see him or her killed. Something that is clearly outside the circle is fair game. For instance, most people would place all other people within the circle, but most of us are willing to see bacteria killed when we brush our teeth, and certainly don't worry when we see an inanimate rock tossed aside to keep a trail clear.The tricky part is that some entities reside close to the edge of the circle. The deepest controversies often involve whether something or someone should lie just inside or just outside the circle. For instance, the idea of slavery depends on the placement of the slave outside the circle, to make some people nonhuman. Widening the circle to include all people and end slavery has been one of the epic strands of the human story - and it isn't quite over yet.A great many other controversies fit well in the model. The fight over abortion asks whether a fetus or embryo should be in the circle or not, and the animal rights debate asks the same about animals.When you change the contents of your circle, you change your conception of yourself. The center of the circle shifts as its perimeter is changed. The liberal impulse is to expand the circle, while conservatives tend to want to restrain or even contract the circle. Empathy Inflation and Metaphysical AmbiguityAre there any legitimate reasons not to expand the circle as much as possible?There are. To expand the circle indefinitely can lead to oppression, because the rights of potential entities (as perceived by only some people) can conflict with the rights of indisputably real people. An obvious example of this is found in the abortion debate. If outlawing abortions did not involve commandeering control of the bodies of other people (pregnant women, in this case), then there wouldn't be much controversy. We would find an easy accommodation.Empathy inflation can also lead to the lesser, but still substantial, evils of incompetence, trivialization, dishonesty, and narcissism.
