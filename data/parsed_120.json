In this situation, no useful purpose is served by trying to separate the mother and father and keep the daughter at home. The daughter has already been emotionally expelled from her family; removing her to protective custody is simply the concrete expression of the family reality.These are the cases which many agencies call their \u201ctragedies.\u201d This report of a child protective worker illustrates a case where removing the child from the home was the only reasonable course of action:Division of Family and Children\u2019s Services received an anonymous telephone call on Sept. 14 from a man who stated that heoverheard Tracy W., age 8, of [address] tell his daughter of a forced oral-genital assault, allegedly perpetrated against this child by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, one Raymond S.Two workers visited the W. home on Sept. 17. According to their report, Mrs. W. was heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the visit. Mrs. W. stated immediately that she was aware why the two workers wanted to see her, because Mr. S. had \u201churt her little girl.\u201d In the course of the interview, Mrs. W. acknowledged and described how Mr. S. had forced Tracy to have relations with him. Workers then interviewed Tracy and she verified what mother had stated. According to Mrs. W., Mr. S. admitted the sexual assault, claiming that he was drunk and not accountable for his actions. Mother then stated to workers that she banished Mr. S. from her home.I had my first contact with mother and child at their home on Sept. 20 and I subsequently saw this family once a week. Mother was usually intoxicated and drinking beer when I saw her. I met Mr. S. on my second visit. Mr. S. denied having had any sexual relations with Tracy. Mother explained that she had obtained a license and planned to marry Mr. S.On my third visit, Mrs. W. was again intoxicated and drinking despite my previous request that she not drink during my visit. Mother explained that Mr. S. had taken off to another state and she never wanted to see him again. On this visit mother demanded that Tracy tell me the details of her sexual involvement with Mr. S. On my fourth visit, Mr. S. and Mrs. S. were present. Mother explained that they had been married the previous Saturday. On my fifth visit, Mr. S. was not present. During our discussion, mother commented that \u201cBay was not the \ufb01rst one who hadTracy.\u201d After exploring this statement with mother and Tracy, it became clear that Tracy had been sexually exploited in the same manner at age six by another of Mrs. S.'s previous boyfriends.On my sixth visit, Mrs. S. stated that she could accept Tracy\u2019s being placed with another family as long as it did not appear to Tracy that it was her mother\u2019s decision to give her up. Mother also commented, \u201cI wish the fuck I never had her.\u201dIt appears that Mrs. S. has had a number of other children all of whom have lived with other relatives or were in foster care for part of their lives.

They are born with a bit of angel-shine about them, and though it wears thin sometimes, there is always enough left to lasso your heart\u2014even when they are sitting in the mud, or crying temperamental tears, or parading up the street in Mother\u2019s best clothes.A little girl can be sweeter (and badder) oftener than anyone else in the world. She can jitter around, and stomp, and make funny noises that frazzle your nerves, yet just when you open your mouth, she stands there demure with that special look in her eyes. A girl is Innocence playing in the mud, Beauty standing on its head, and Motherhood dragging a doll by the foot.God borrows from many creatures to make a little girl. He uses the song of a bird, the squeal of a pig, the stubbornness of a mule, the antics of a monkey, the spryness of a grasshopper, the curiosity of a cat, the speed of a gazelle, the slyness of a fox, the softness of a kitten, and to top it all off He adds the mysterious mind of a woman.A little girl likes new shoes, party dresses, small animals, first grade, noisemakers, the girl next door, dolls, make-believe, dancing lessons, ice cream, kitchens, coloring books, make-up, cans of water, going visiting, tea parties, and one boy. She doesn\u2019t care so much for visitors, boys in general, large dogs, hand-me-downs, straight chairs, vegetables, snowsuits, or staying in the front yard.She is loudest when you are thinking, the prettiest when she has provoked you, the busiest at bedtime, the quietest when you want to show her off, and the most flirtatious when she absolutely must not get the best of you again. Who else can cause you more grief, joy, irritation, satisfaction, embarrassment, and genuine delight than this combination of Eve, Salome, and Florence Nightingale.She can muss up your home, your hair, and your dignity\u2014spend your money, your time, and your patience\u2014and just when your temper is ready to crack, her sunshine peeks through and you\u2019ve lost again. Yes, she is a nerve-wracking nuisance, just a noisy bundle of mischief.

The dolls \"provoked rejection, hatred, and violence\" and many girls preferred Barbie torture -- by cutting, burning, decapitating, or microwaving -- over other ways of playing with the doll. Reasons that the girls hated their Barbies included, somewhat poetically, the fact that they were 'plastic.' The researchers also noted that the girls never spoke of one single, special Barbie, but tended to talk about having a box full of anonymous Barbies. 'On a deeper level Barbie has become inanimate,' one of the researchers remarked. 'She has lost any individual warmth that she might have possessed if she were perceived as a singular person.

However, every girl I spoke with, every single girl\u2014regardless of her class, ethnicity, or sexual orientation; regardless of what she wore, regardless of her appearance\u2014had been harassed in middle school, high school, college, or, often, all three. Who, then, is truly at risk of being \u201cdistracted\u201d at school? At best, blaming girls\u2019 clothing for the thoughts and actions of boys is counterproductive. At worst, it\u2019s a short step from there to \u201cshe was asking for it.\u201d Yet, I also can\u2019t help but feel that girls such as Camila, who favors what she called \u201cmore so-called provocative\u201d clothing, are missing something. Taking up the right to bare arms (and legs and cleavage and midriffs) as a feminist rallying cry strikes me as suspiciously Orwellian. I recall the simple litmus test for sexism proposed by British feminist Caitlin Moran, one that Camila unconsciously referenced: Are the guys doing it, too? \u201cIf they aren\u2019t,\u201d Moran wrote, \u201cchances are you\u2019re dealing with what we strident feminists refer to as \u2018some total fucking bullshit.\u2019\u201d So while only girls get catcalled, it\u2019s also true that only girls\u2019 fashions urge body consciousness at the very youngest ages. Target offers bikinis for infants. The Gap hawks \u201cskinny jeans\u201d for toddlers. Preschoolers worship Disney princesses, characters whose eyes are larger than their waists. No one is trying to convince eleven-year-old boys to wear itty-bitty booty shorts or bare their bellies in the middle of winter. As concerned as I am about the policing of girls\u2019 sexuality through clothing, I also worry about the incessant drumbeat of self-objectification: the pressure on young women to reduce their worth to their bodies and to see those bodies as a collection of parts that exist for others\u2019 pleasure; to continuously monitor their appearance; to perform rather than to feel sensuality. I recall a conversation I had with Deborah Tolman, a professor at Hunter College and perhaps the foremost expert on teenage girls\u2019 sexual desire.

There would be no secondary, or parasitic, discussion - let alone tertiary: commentary on commentary. We would have, instead, a \"republic for writers and readers\" with no cushion of professional opinion-makers to come between creators and audience. While the Sunday papers presently serve as a substitute for the experiencing of the actual exhibition or book, in Steiner's imagined republic the review pages would be turned into listings:catalogues and guides to what is about to open, be published, or be released. What would this republic be like? Would the arts suffer from the obliteration of this ozone of comment? Certainly not, says Steiner, for each performance of a Mahler symphony is also a critique of that symphony. Unlike the reviewer, however, the performer \"invests his own being in the process of interpretation.\" Such interpretation is automatically responsible because the performer is answerable to the work in a way that even the most scrupulous reviewer is not. Although, most obviously, it is not only the case for drama and music; all art is also criticism. This is most clearly so when a writer or composer quotes or reworks material from another writer or composer. All literature, music, and art \"embody an expository reflection which they pertain\". In other words it is not only in their letters, essays, or conversation that writers like Henry James reveal themselves also to be the best critics; rather, The Portrait of a Lady is itself, among other things, a commentary on and a critique of Middlemarch. \"The best readings of art are art.\"No sooner has Steiner summoned this imaginary republic into existence than he sighs, \"The fantasy I have sketched is only that.\" Well, it is not.

I'm going to remember what you looked like forever.... And I hope you remember me the same way - clean, ha-ha. I'm glad our last time together was happy.But I'm leaving tonight, leaving the flock, and this time it's for good. I don't know if I'll ever see any of you again. The thing is, Max, that everyone is a little bit right. Added up all together, it makes this one big right.Dylan's a little bit right about how my being here might be putting the rest of you in danger. The threat might have been just about Dr. Hans, but we don't know that for sure. Angel is a little bit right about how splitting up the flock will help all of us survive. And the rest of the flock is a little bit right about how when you and I are together, we're focused on each other - we can't help it.The thing is, Maximum, I love you. I can't help but be focused on you when we're together. If you're in the room, I want to be next to you. If you're gone, I think about you. You're the one who I want to talk to. In a fight, I want you at my back. When we're together, the sun is shining. When we're apart, everything is in shades of gray.I hope you'll forgive me someday for turning our worlds into shades of gray - at least for a while....You're not at your best when you're focused on me. I mean, you're at your best Maxness, but not your best leaderness. I mostly need Maxness. The flock mostly needs leaderness. And Angel, if you're listening to this, it ain't you, sweetie. Not yet....At least for a couple more years, the flock needs a leader to survive, no matter how capable everyone thinks he or she is. The truth is that they do need a leader, and the truth is that you are the best leader. It's one of the things I love about you.But the more I thought about it, the more sure I got that this is the right thing to do. Maybe not for you, or for me, but for all of us together, our flock.Please don't try to find me. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, besides wearing that suit today, and seeing you again will only make it harder. You'd ask me to come back, and I would, because I can't say no to you. But all the same problems would still be there, and I'd end up leaving again, and then we'd have to go through this all over again.Please make us only go through this once....I love you. I love your smile, your snarl, your grin, your face when you're sleeping. I love your hair streaming out behind you as we fly, with the sunlight making it shine, if it doesn't have too much mud or blood in it. I love seeing your wings spreading out, white and brown and tan and speckled, and the tiny, downy feathers right at the top of your shoulders. I love your eyes, whether they're cold or calculating or suspicious or laughing or warm, like when you look at me....You're the best warrior I know, the best leader. You're the most comforting mom we've ever had. You're the biggest goofball, the worst driver, and a truly lousy cook. You've kept us safe and provided for us, in good times and bad. You're my best friend, my first and only love, and the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, with wings or without....Tell you what, sweetie: If in twenty years we haven't expired yet, and the world is still more or less in one piece, I'll meet you at the top of that cliff where we first met the hawks and learned to fly with them. You know the one. Twenty years from today, if I'm alive, I'll be there, waiting for you. You can bet on it.Good-bye, my love.FangP.S.

God bless the Rixeys\u2019 ice-cream addiction. There were so many containers, it seemed entirely plausible that they\u2019d robbed an ice-cream delivery truck. He sorted through the tubs until he found a container of chocolate. Bingo. Next, he grabbed the milk from the fridge. And then he opened a bunch of cabinets until he found a blender at the back of one of them. The layer of dust on its surfaces told of how long it had gone unused. He rinsed and wiped it off, then brought the detachable pitcher to the other counter, where the ice cream lay waiting. Shane\u2019s expression was two seconds away from amused. \u201cNot a word, McCallan.\u201d He held up his hands and shook his head, but he couldn\u2019t hold back the smile. Fucker. Scoop, scoop, scoop, milk. Lid on, Easy placed the container on the blender and hit mix. Two minutes later, he had something approximating a very thick milk shake. He spooned it into a glass, then gathered the bagel and soup. Next he built his sandwich, sneaking pieces of beef and cheese as he worked. \u201cDamn, that looks good,\u201d Shane said, pushing off the stool and grabbing a plate for himself. \u201cThink I\u2019ll make some food for me and Sara, too.\u201d Easy suddenly felt less self-conscious with Shane making food for his woman, too.

Fuck. Sake. Not that Easy was particularly surprised by the question. Hadn\u2019t he been half expecting it? And, his brain noted with interest, it wasn\u2019t a warning off. \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Shane said in that same casual, even tone. \u201cI see how protective you are of her, Easy, and I\u2019m glad for that. I know you\u2019ll treat her right, so I\u2019m not saying a thing about it, except handle with care.\u201d Nodding, Easy concentrated on making the floor stand still under his feet. \u201cI like her, Shane,\u201d he finally said, echoing the conversation he and Shane had had a few nights ago about Shane\u2019s growing feelings for Sara. And, well, hi, how ya doin\u2019, Mr. Hypocrite, Easy had told Shane he had to come clean with the team. Despite the fact that Easy hadn\u2019t done so himself. Still. \u201cYeah,\u201d Shane said, clapping him on the back of the neck and squeezing. \u201cI know.\u201d Wow.From the thin cabinet next to the oven Easy retrieved a baking sheet to use as a tray.
