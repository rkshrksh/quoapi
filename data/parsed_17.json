You\u2019ve been a consultant for a long time, and you\u2019ve dealt a great deal with top secret information. But you\u2019re about to receive a whole slew of special clearances, maybe fifteen or twenty of them, that are higher than top secret.I\u2019ve had a number of these myself, and I\u2019ve known other people who have just acquired them, and I have a pretty good sense of what the effects of receiving these clearances are on a person who didn\u2019t previously know they even existed. And the effects of reading the information that they will make available to you.First, you\u2019ll be exhilarated by some of this new information, and by having it all\u2014so much! incredible!\u2014suddenly available to you. But second, almost as fast, you will feel like a fool for having studied, written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of all this information, which presidents and others had and you didn\u2019t, and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldn\u2019t even guess. In particular, you\u2019ll feel foolish for having literally rubbed shoulders for over a decade with some officials and consultants who did have access to all this information you didn\u2019t know about and didn\u2019t know they had, and you\u2019ll be stunned that they kept that secret from you so well.You will feel like a fool, and that will last for about two weeks. Then, after you\u2019ve started reading all this daily intelligence input and become used to using what amounts to whole libraries of hidden information, which is much more closely held than mere top secret data, you will forget there ever was a time when you didn\u2019t have it, and you\u2019ll be aware only of the fact that you have it now and most others don\u2019t \u2026 and that all those other people are fools.Over a longer period of time\u2014not too long, but a matter of two or three years\u2014you\u2019ll eventually become aware of the limitations of this information. There is a great deal that it doesn\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s often inaccurate, and it can lead you astray just as much as the New York Times can. But that takes a while to learn.In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from anybody who doesn\u2019t have these clearances. Because you\u2019ll be thinking as you listen to them: \u201cWhat would this man be telling me if he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his predictions and recommendations?\u201d And that mental exercise is so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening. I\u2019ve seen this with my superiors, my colleagues \u2026 and with myself.You will deal with a person who doesn\u2019t have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since you\u2019ll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You\u2019ll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The danger is, you\u2019ll become something like a moron.

Hence emerged the reason for me to get to the root of its quite unofficially accepted problems, and to concoct the thought processes that would make necessary amendments to the perceptual errors of what I call the three major nodes of education system, which are the teachers, the students and the parents.", "author": "Abhijit Naskar, The Education Decree", "tags": "brainy-quotes, education, education-system, educational, educational-philosophy, inspirational-inspiring, knowledge, learning, learning-process, motivational, parents, pursuit-of-knowledge, students, teachers, teaching, wisdom, words-of-wisdom"}, {"quote": "Education is not the amount of information that is pushed into the brain and causes havoc there, undigested all through a lifetime.

Unfortunately, that kind of education is virtually calculated to bore and alienate gifted minds. But instead of making exceptions where it would do the most good, the educational bureaucracy often prefers not to be bothered.In my case, for example, much of the schooling to which I was subjected was probably worse than nothing. It consisted not of real education, but of repetition and oppressive socialization (entirely superfluous given the dose of oppression I was getting away from school). Had I been left alone, preferably with access to a good library and a minimal amount of high-quality instruction, I would at least have been free to learn without useless distractions and gratuitous indoctrination. But alas, no such luck.Let\u2019s try to break the problem down a bit. The education system [\u2026] is committed to a warm and fuzzy but scientifically counterfactual form of egalitarianism which attributes all intellectual differences to environmental factors rather than biology, implying that the so-called 'gifted' are just pampered brats who, unless their parents can afford private schooling, should atone for their undeserved good fortune by staying behind and enriching the classroom environments of less privileged students.This approach may appear admirable, but its effects on our educational and intellectual standards, and all that depends on them, have already proven to be overwhelmingly negative. This clearly betrays an ulterior motive, suggesting that it has more to do with social engineering than education. There is an obvious difference between saying that poor students have all of the human dignity and basic rights of better students, and saying that there are no inherent educationally and socially relevant differences among students. The first statement makes sense, while the second does not.The gifted population accounts for a very large part of the world\u2019s intellectual resources. As such, they can obviously be put to better use than smoothing the ruffled feathers of average or below-average students and their parents by decorating classroom environments which prevent the gifted from learning at their natural pace. The higher we go on the scale of intellectual brilliance \u2013 and we\u2019re not necessarily talking just about IQ \u2013 the less support is offered by the education system, yet the more likely are conceptual syntheses and grand intellectual achievements of the kind seldom produced by any group of markedly less intelligent people. In some cases, the education system is discouraging or blocking such achievements, and thus cheating humanity of their benefits.", "author": "Christopher Langan", "tags": "autodidacticism, brilliance, brilliant, bureaucracy, children, education-reform, educational-system, genius, gifted, gifted-people, giftedness, good-intentions, indoctrination, intellectual, knowledge, sad-truth, science, self-education, simple-truth, social-justice, socialization, the-road-to-hell, unfairness, youth"}, {"quote": "The system that aims at educating our boys and girls in the same manner as in the circus where the trainer teaches the lion to sit on a stool, has not understood the true meaning of education itself.

This consciousness may be present or it may grow in an organic manner, like a tree or an animal organism. The growth of this consciousness of social responsibility is the most important prerequisite for the prevention of the cancer-like growth of political systems in the social organism. If they are allowed to grow, they will sooner or later bring about social chaos. Furthermore, such consciousness of responsibility alone will, in the course of time, bring the institutions of human society into harmony with the natural functions of work democracy. Political systems come and go without stopping or fundamentally changing the social process. But the pulse of human society would stopand not return should the natural life functions of love, work and knowledge cease for only one day.

Sure, this turns out to be a subjective analysis, but in the process your own attitudes toward financial risk and reward are revealed.By contrast, personal risk usually defies quantification. It's a matter of values and priorities, an expression of who you are. \"Playing it safe\" may simply mean you do not weigh heavily the compromises inherent in the status quo. The financial rewards of the moment may fully compensate you for the loss of time and fulfillment. Or maybe you just don't think about it. On the other hand, if time and satisfaction are precious, truly priceless, you will find the cost of business failure, so long as it does not put in peril the well-being of you or your family, pales in comparison with the personal risks of no trying to live the life you want today.Considering personal risk forces us to define personal success. We may well discover that the business failure we avoid and the business success we strive for do not lead us to personal success at all. Most of us have inherited notions of \"success\" from someone else or have arrived at these notions by facing a seemingly endless line of hurdles extending from grade school through college and into our careers. We constantly judge ourselves against criteria that others have set and rank ourselves against others in their game. Personal goals, on the other hand, leave us on our own, without this habit of useless measurement and comparison.Only the Whole Life Plan leads to personal success. It has the greatest chance of providing satisfaction and contentment that one can take to the grave, tomorrow.
