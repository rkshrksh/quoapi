We settle for the person we love over the person who could push us \u2013 to be bigger, stronger, greater versions of ourselves. We tell ourselves that love is enough. That it conquers everything. But we forget that love shouldn\u2019t be the thing that conquers our lives \u2013 we should be. And we should do it deliberately, triumphantly, by the side of somebody who shares all of our joys and successes.So how do we meet such a person? That\u2019s simple \u2013 we do more of what we love. We give ourselves up to uncertainty, to searching, to pursuing what we want out of life without the certainty of having someone beside us while we do it. We throw ourselves wholeheartedly into the things that we love and we consequently attract the people who love what we love. Who value what we prioritize. Who appreciate all that we are. We throw ourselves into the heart of possibility instead of staying comfortably settled inside of certainty. Because we owe it to ourselves to do so. We owe it to ourselves to live the greatest life that we\u2019re capable of living, even if that means that we have to be alone for a very long time.At the end of the day, love is wonderful but it isn\u2019t enough to make up for an entire lifetime of compromising your core values. You don\u2019t want to spend forever gazing into somebody\u2019s eyes expecting to find all of the answers you need inside of them.

Know and remember this.Cling to your faith.Roll your spiritual sleeves up and get to work. Use your energy wisely. Transmute all anger, panic and fear into light and empowerment.Don't use what fuels them; all lower-energy.Mourn as you need to. Console who you need to\u2014and then go get into the spiritual and energetic arena. There's plenty work for us to do; within and without.Let's each focus on becoming 'The President of Our Own Life.Cultivate your mind. Pursue your purpose. Shine your light. Elevate past\u2014and reject\u2014any culture of low vibrational energy and ratchetness. Don't take fear, defeat or anger\u2014on or in.The system is doing what they've been created to do.Are you? Am I? Are we\u2014collectively?Let's get to work.No more drifting through life without your higher-self in complete control of your mind.Awaken\u2014fully. Activate\u2014now. Put your frustrations or concerns into your work.Don't lose sight. There is still\u2014a higher plan.Let's ride this 4 year energetic-wave like the spiritual gangsters that we are.This will all be the past soon. Let's get to work and stay dedicated, consistent and diligent. Again, this will all be the past soon. We have preparing and work to do.Toxic energy is so not a game.Toxic energy and low vibrations are being collectively acted out on the world stage.Covertly operating through the unconscious weak spots and blind spots in the human psyche; making people oblivious to their own madness, causing and influencing them to act against\u2013their\u2013own\u2013best\u2013interests and higher-good, as if under a spell and unconsciously possessed. This means that they are actually nourishing the lower vibrational energy with their lifestyle, choices, energy and habits, which is unconsciously giving the lower-energy the very power and fuel it needs\u2014for repeating and recreating endless drama, suffering and destruction, in more and more amplified forms on a national and world stage.So what do we do? We take away its autonomy and power over us while at the same time empowering ourselves. By recognizing how this energetic/spiritual virus or parasite of the mind\u2014operates through our unawareness is the beginning of the cure. Knowledge is power. Applied knowledge is\u2014freedom.Our shared future will be decided primarily by the changes that take place in the psyche of humanity, starting with each of us\u2014 vibrationally.In closing and most importantly,the greatest protection against becoming affected or possessed by this lower-energy is to be in touch with our higher vibrational-self. We have to call our energy and power back. Being in touch with our higher-self and true nature acts as a sacred amulet, shielding and protecting us from the attempted effects. We defeat evil not by fighting against it (in which case, by playing its game, we\u2019ve already lost) but by getting in touch with the part of us that is invulnerable to its effects\u2014 our higher vibrational-self.Will this defeat and destroy us?Or will it awaken us more and more?Everything depends upon our recognizing what is being revealed to us and our stepping out of the unconscious influence of low vibrational/negative/toxic/evil/distraction energy (or whatever name you relate to it as)that is and has been seeking power over each of our lives energetically and/or spiritually, and step into our wholeness, our personal power, our higher self and vibrate higher and higher daily.Stay woke my friends\u2014let's get to work.", "author": "Lalah Delia", "tags": "activism, america, black-lives-matter, courage, do-the-work, energetic, energy, get-involved, guru, heal-the-world, higher-good, inspiration, journey, lalah-delia, motivational, native-lives-matter, one-love, social-issues, speak-up, spirit, spirituality, stay-woke, students, teacher, the-work, unity, vibes, vibrate-higher, vibrational, wholeness"}, {"quote": "A new mind, equals a new life.", "author": "Lalah Delia", "tags": "brain-function, encouragement, growth, inspirational-quotes, lalah-delia, meditation, mind, mind-power, mindfulness, motivation, motivational, personal-growth, spirituality, spirituality-quotes, transformation"}, {"quote": "I always stay hungry, never satisfied with current accomplishments.", "author": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "tags": "inspirational-quotes, motivational"}, {"quote": "Work and pray rather instead of watching and wishing.", "author": "Anonymous", "tags": "inspirational, motivational"}, {"quote": "I am not confined to the standard of society.

Live your life as an exclamation, not an explanation. Loosen up. Relax. Except for rare life and death matters, nothing is as important as it first seems. Never cut what can be untied. Never overestimate your power to change others. Never underestimate your power to change yourself. Remember that overnight success usually takes about fifteen years. Remember that winners do what losers don't want to do. Seek opportunity, not security. A boat in harbor is safe, but in time its bottom will rot out. Spend less time worrying who's right, more time deciding what's right. Stop blaming others. Take responsibility for every area of your life. Success is getting what you want.

And, then, there\u2019s 28. I don\u2019t know what it is about this age in particular, but I\u2019ve deemed it \u201cThe Crisis Year\u201d and here\u2019s why.1. The realization that you\u2019re now officially in your \u201clate 20s\u201d is enough to send you straight into the climax of a full-blown panic attack. You don\u2019t even get to start at the beginning of the said attack, no. You wake up on your 28th birthday, screaming and dry heaving. It\u2019s an instinctual reaction to knowing that, for the next 365 days of your life, you will be teetering on the fine line between actual adulthood and clutching on desperately to your youth.2. Because you\u2019re now in your late 20s, your parents start to treat you more like an GULP adult. Even if you\u2019ve been paying your own way since forever, maybe you both secretly knew deep down that, in case of a huge emergency, asking them for help wasn\u2019t off-limits. But, when 28 hits, it\u2019s no longer an option.3. You just feel old(er). There\u2019s something about the curvy lines of the number \u201c8\u201d that cast a darker and much more serious shadow over things. You\u2019ll still go out to popular nightlife establishments, but you will be internally ashamed about your age the entire time you\u2019re there. And the horror if someone is to ask you how old you are! Being 26 in a nightclub is vastly different. Probably because you\u2019re still in your mid-20s and because the shape of the number \u201c6\u201d is naturally fun and loopy, so it makes you feel safe.4. Everyone you know is getting engaged.5. Everyone you know is getting married.6. Almost everyone you know who is married, is pregnant.7. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 after graduation, no one\u2019s never not getting married. Before your eyes, your Facebook feed turns into an endless stream of engagement announcements. And, unless you decide to cast yourself out of society, this parade of seemingly happy couples moving forward together won\u2019t slow down until probably age 30. But there\u2019s something about the specific age of 28 that lends itself to just being drowned in marriage announcements no matter where you turn. It\u2019s either couples who have been together for 6+ years finally taking the plunge, or \u201creal world\u201d couples who met a few years ago and got super serious, super fast. Either way, it\u2019s a single 28-year-old\u2019s worst nightmare.8. Being tw0 years away from 30 is a bleak reality to face. Four years is like no big deal, because that\u2019s an entire university experience. But two? Two will soon be one, and then you\u2019re 30. 20somethings are delusional in many ways, but one of the biggest is how we think, by 30, our entire lives should be figured out. Married, babies, dream job, bla bla bla \u2013 all by 30. It\u2019s a subtle attitude we all have that wants to scream, \u201c30 OR BUST!\u201d But, the closer you inch toward that milestone birthday, the more you realize what a total crock of shit all that is. And how you couldn\u2019t be further away from having it all figured out if you tried.9. Going back to one of the first points I made, being 28 is like being a brand new, beginner\u2019s level gymnast, perilously seesawing between \u201creal\u201d adulthood and (what feel like) the last crumbs of your true youth. Half of you feels an enormous pressure to fully grow-up, while the other half of you is crippled by the notion of doing so. On one hand, you are sort of ready to get serious about love, career, and overall responsibility. On the other hand, you just want to continue making out at random, dating idiots, and generally freaking the fuck out over the future.

Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plants appear, followed twenty minutes later by the first jellyfish and the enigmatic Ediacaran fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 P.M. trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by the shapely creatures of the Burgess Shale. Just before 10 P.M. plants begin to pop up on the land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in the day, the first land creatures follow. Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs plod onto the scene just before 11 P.M. and hold sway for about three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they vanish and the age of mammals begins. Humans emerge one minute and seventeen seconds before midnight. The whole of our recorded history, on this scale, would be no more than a few seconds, a single human lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded-up day continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw. And throughout the whole, about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson-sized meteor or one even larger.

It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time. The value of time must change for us. And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely. That change in feeling and in thinking is combined in the words of a prophet of God in this dispensation. It was Brigham Young, and the year was 1877, and he was speaking at April general conference. He wasn't talking about time or schedules or frustrations with too many demands upon us. Rather, he was trying to teach the members of the Church how to unite themselves in what was called the united order. The Saints were grappling with the question of how property should be distributed if they were to live the celestial law. In his usual direct style, he taught the people that they were having trouble finding solutions because they misunderstood the problem. Particularly, he told them they didn't understand either property or the distribution of wealth. Here is what he said: With regard to our property, as I have told you many times, the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father; all the rest is what he may be pleased to add unto us. To direct, to counsel and to advise in the disposition of our time, pertains to our calling as God's servants, according to the wisdom which he has given and will continue to give unto us as we seek it. [JD 18:354] Time is the property we inherit from God, along with the power to choose what we will do with it. President Young calls the gift of life, which is time and the power to dispose of it, so great an inheritance that we should feel it is our capital. The early Yankee families in America taught their children and grandchildren some rules about an inheritance. They were always to invest the capital they inherited and live only on part of the earnings. One rule was \"Never spend your capital.\" And those families had confidence the rule would be followed because of an attitude of responsibility toward those who would follow in later generations. It didn't always work, but the hope was that inherited wealth would be felt a trust so important that no descendent would put pleasure ahead of obligation to those who would follow. Now, I can see and hear Brigham Young, who was as flinty a New Englander as the Adams or the Cabots ever hoped to be, as if he were leaning over this pulpit tonight. He would say something like this, with a directness and power I wish I could approach: \"Your inheritance is time. It is capital far more precious than any lands or stocks or houses you will ever get. Spend it foolishly, and you will bankrupt yourself and cheapen the inheritance of those that follow you.

Modern man need not become a hermit to achieve this goal, for it is neither ecstasy nor world-estranged mysticism his era demands, but a balance between quantitative and qualitative reality. Modern man, with his reduced capacity for intuitive perception, is unlikely to benefit from the contemplative life of a hermit in the wilderness. But what he can do is to give undivided attention, at times, to a natural phenomenon, observing it in detail, and recalling all the scientific facts about it he may remember. Gradually, however, he must silence his thoughts and, for moments at least, forget all his personal cares and desires, until nothing remains in his soul but awe for the miracle before him. Such efforts are like journeys beyond the boundaries of narrow self-love and, although the process of intuitive awakening is laborious and slow, its rewards are noticeable from the very first. If pursued through the course of years, something will begin to stir in the human soul, a sense of kinship with the forces of life consciousness which rule the world of plants and animals, and with the powers which determine the laws of matter. While analytical intellect may well be called the most precious fruit of the Modern Age, it must not be allowed to rule supreme in matters of cognition.

Time simply is. It\u2019s the framework in which we play out the games of our lives, but the secret is not to control it. It is not to master it. It is simply to learn to exist fully within the moment, to be aware of every facet of our being, and to wring every ounce of joy from it. Perhaps we were our own thieves, lamenting the absence of even a spare moment to enjoy life, when all it really takes is to stop the complaints, take the moment firmly in hand, and make it our own.

You may joke that the week you went on vacation flew by far too quickly, but if you stop and think about it, that week actually seemed to last much longer than one involving the drudgery of your day job.
