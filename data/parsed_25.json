I did not have book role models, I had book blueprints.But there remained a huge gap between the person I wanted to be and the person who I was. This was because no matter how many book blueprints I had, as much as I wanted to make myself the hero of my own life, it didn\u2019t matter as long as I kept telling the story wrong.Nowadays, as a storyteller, I know what the problem was. I had all the elements I needed to tell a good story.

Likewise, if you tell yourself you\u2019re a loser, you\u2019ve made that your story, and you will march toward that instead. The same setbacks could happen in the loser\u2019s story as in the winner\u2019s story, but the self-defined loser would let them be proof that they were never going to be anything.Here\u2019s the story I was telling myself back when I was little edible child waiting to be carried away by hawks and making OCD rituals for herself: once upon a time, there was a girl who was afraid of everything. When I was 16, I realized that I knew what this story looked like and how it ended, and it wasn\u2019t the life I wanted for myself. If I wanted my ending to look different, I needed to change the kind of story I was telling about myself. I needed to shape my events into a different genre: once upon a time, there was a woman who was afraid of nothing. At age 16, I legally changed my name from my birthname \u2014 Heidi \u2014 to one I thought sounded like the hero I wanted to be: Maggie.
