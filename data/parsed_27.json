It\u2019s my nature!\u2019 Until God changes the other person\u2019s nature, they have the power to affect and infect you. For example, when you feel passionately about something but others don\u2019t, it\u2019s like trying to dance a foxtrot with someone who only knows how to waltz. You picked the wrong dance partner! Don\u2019t get tied up with someone who doesn\u2019t share your values and God-given goals. Some issues can be corrected through counselling, prayer, teaching, and leadership. But you can\u2019t teach someone to care; if they don\u2019t care they\u2019ll pollute your environment, kill your productivity, and break your rhythm with constant complaints.

Why was it admirable when you were twenty-seven but creepy when you were thirty-seven? Why wasn\u2019t friendship as good as a relationship? Why wasn\u2019t it even better? It was two people who remained together, day after day, bound not by sex or physical attraction or money or children or property, but only by the shared agreement to keep going, the mutual dedication to a union that could never be codified. Friendship was witnessing another\u2019s slow drip of miseries, and long bouts of boredom, and occasional triumphs.

The simple one is: excellence. But if that were all, we'd just use Excellence and I wouldn't bring it up until we got to E. Arete means your own excellence. Your very own. A personal excellence that belongs to no one else, one that comes out of all the things that make you special and different. Arete means whatever you are best at, no matter what that is. You might think the Greeks only meant things like fighting with bronze swords or debating philosophy, but they didn't. They meant whatever you're best at. What makes you feel like you're doing the rightest thing in the world. And that might be fighting with bronze swords and it might mean debating philosophy\u2014but it also might mean building machines, or drawing pictures, or playing the guitar, or acting in Shakespeare plays, or writing books, or making a home for people who need one, or listening so hard and so well that people tell you the things they really need to say even if they didn't mean to, or running faster than anyone else, or teaching people patiently and boldly, or even making pillow forts or marching in parades or baking bread.

No way, he is seeing the shoes, shoes that tramp, limp, scuffle along, and perhaps his greatest concern is the tiny bug they might step on.It is probably the true meaning of compassionate, wondering about people's passions, thier feelings. Passion, one of the loveliest words in the language, one of the most misunderstood. One can have a love for so many things, but novelists sometimes overwork the word. Perhaps one can have a passionate belief, but not a passionate love for a car or asparagus. Passion is private, gentle, consuming, understanding and personal. It expresses so many things but does not belong to lipstick. It is in nature, pictures, people, always people. I suppose compassion begins when you watch the shoes and worry about the bug.", "author": "Leonard Budgell, Arctic Twilight: Leonard Budgell and Canada's Changing North", "tags": "compassion, compassionate, humor, nature, passion, people, philosophy"}, {"quote": "Being understanding is a curse because even if they hurt you,they are convinced \"you will understand", "author": "Himmilicious", "tags": "love, people, relationship, understanding"}, {"quote": "Every time you make a choice you\u2019re taking time and effort away from something or someone else.

Then the handful will shout louder. A few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war with speech and pen, and at first will have a hearing and be applauded; but it will not last long; those others will outshout them, and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity. Before long you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers--as earlier--but do not dare say so. And now the whole nation--pulpit and all--will take up the war-cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths will cease to open. Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.", "author": "Mark Twain, The Mysterious Stranger and Other Stories", "tags": "war"}, {"quote": "Let my country die for me.", "author": "James Joyce, Ulysses", "tags": "war"}, {"quote": "Last year nothing happenedThe year before nothing happenedAnd the year before that nothinghappened.", "author": "Osamu Dazai, The Setting Sun", "tags": "japanese, war"}, {"quote": "Every true artist is at war with the world.", "author": "Anthony Kiedis, Scar Tissue", "tags": "art, artist, war"}, {"quote": "You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you.", "author": "Leon Trotsky", "tags": "war"}, {"quote": "Great results, can be achieved with small forces.", "author": "Sun Tzu, The Art of War", "tags": "business, strategy, war"}, {"quote": "He always considered death an unavoidable professional hazard.", "author": "Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Chronicle of a Death Foretold", "tags": "war"}, {"quote": "Those with the least always lose the most in war.", "author": "Joe Abercrombie, Before They Are Hanged", "tags": "war"}, {"quote": "A weapon does not decide whether or not to kill.

There can be circumstances when it's just as foolish to hit an enemy with an H-Bomb as it would be to spank a baby with an ax. War is not violence and killing, pure and simple; war is controlled violence, for a purpose. The purpose of war is to support your government's decisions by force. The purpose is never to kill the enemy just to be killing him . . . but to make him do what you want him to do. Not killing . . . but controlled and purposeful violence. But it's not your business or mine to decide the purpose of the control. It's never a soldier's business to decide when or where or how--or why--he fights; that belongs to the statesmen and the generals. The statesmen decide why and how much; the generals take it from there and tell us where and when and how. We supply the violence; other people--\"older and wiser heads,\" as they say--supply the control. Which is as it should be. That's the best answer I can give you.

In his hatred for the Allende Government, Kissinger even outdid Richard Helms ... who warned him that a coup in such a stable democracy would be hard to procure. The murder of Schneider nonetheless went ahead, at Kissinger\u2019s urging and with American financing, just between Allende\u2019s election and his confirmation....

Germany, having let Hell loose, kept well in the van of terror; but she was followed step by step by the desperate and ultimately avenging nations she had assailed. Every outrage against humanity or international law was repaid by reprisals-often of a greater scale and of longer duration. No truce or parley mitigated the strife of the armies. The wounded died between the lines: the dead mouldered into the soil. Merchant ships and neutral ships and hospital ships were sunk on the seas and all on board left to their fate, or killed as they swam. Every effort was made to starve whole nations into submission without regard to age or sex. Cities and monuments were smashed by artillery. Bombs from the air were cast down indiscriminately. Poison gas in many forms stifled or seared the soldiers. Liquid fire was projected upon their bodies. Men fell from the air in flames, or were smothered often slowly in the dark recesses of the sea. The fighting strength of armies was limited only by the manhood of their countries. Europe and large parts of Asia and Africa became one vast battlefield on which after years of struggle not armies but nations broke and ran.
