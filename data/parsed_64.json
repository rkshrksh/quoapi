Possessing \u2018ego vision\u2019, a person\u2019s view through her/his physical eyes is quite versatile; able to discern wide and varied vistas over huge distances or scrutinizing the minutest of details.Ego\u2019s very nature: capable of relatively expansive, detailed, and yet individualistic perspective is crucial. Separating itself out from the God Force, ego extracts infinite unique experiences, integral to humanity\u2019s process of spiritualizing matter. Incarnating on the earth, achieving individualism is therefore critical for attainment of divinity.Individualism may cause momentary estrangement from the God Self. However, this person has forgotten that they are everything in the mirror, the \u2018sliver\u2019 and the \u2018ball of light\u2019,\u201d continues Kuan Yin.During this complex passage Lena was inundated by infinite rapid-fire visuals: emanations from the God Mind.\u201cFurther and unfortunately, wrong assumptions are made about suffering. Some individuals even believe that it is required, that suffering brings one closer to salvation. Quite the contrary,\u201d disputes Kuan Yin, \u201cthe God Force likes to play. Therefore, if all individuals could unite creating a real sense of community many problems could be healed.The God Force is separate and not separate, whole and not whole at the same time. Really, it is not \u2018sliceable\u2019, not reducible. Even when it is sliced into individual energies, it does not diminish the total God Force or the power of the individual.Each of you has the potential for the God Force potency. However, no individual can overcome the God Force. There is a misinterpretation, (by some) that Satan is as powerful as God. Limited energy cannot live on its own. Every experience must exist and yet they (the limiting forces) can never exist on their own. Limited energy, then, is the experience of the absence of the God Force. Therefore, there is no need to fear it.Those choosing such experiences have a need to understand how it feels to believe evil powers exist. Again, I say those who pursue this route are taking it too personally. They believe the story they\u2019ve made up about themselves.It is similar to a person going into an ice cream store and only choosing one flavor from many. Preoccupied with tasting that flavor for a very long time, they are probably quite sick and tired of it. Still, they don\u2019t want to believe there are any other flavors available. The \u2018agreement\u2019, then, is to continue to believe in that particular flavor. Here\u2019s where reincarnation and its opportunity for experiencing a vast array of perspectives, \u201cagreements\u201d, enters in. Another life offers another opportunity, a chance to \u2018switch flavors\u2019 so to speak.Taking oneself too personally, however, can cause a soul to get caught up, stuck in redundancy: in a particular (and perhaps unfortunate) flavor. In such instances, the individual is forgetting one has the ability to choose his or her flavors, lives,\u201d contends Kuan Yin.", "author": "Hope Bradford, Oracle of Compassion: The Living Word of Kuan Yin", "tags": "ego, god-quotes, kuan-yin, kuan-yin-god, kuan-yin-quote, kuan-yin-quotes, reincarnation, reincarnation-quotes, satan, spiritual-quote, spiritual-quotes, spiritualization-of-matter"}, {"quote": "Be strong within ones self, but never forget where ones true strength comes from.", "author": "Jean Williams", "tags": "inspirational-quotes, spiritual-quotes"}, {"quote": "The power of Manifestation is the ability to make seen the unseen, to real~ise the unreal", "author": "Misha Hoo", "tags": "manifestation, philosophy, spiritual-quotes, spiritual-wisdom"}, {"quote": "When you are where wild bears liveyou learn to pay attention to the rhythm of the land and yourself.

To base our forgiveness on any other ground is unconscious blasphemy. The only ground on which God can forgive our sin and reinstate us to His favor is through the Cross of Christ. There is no other way! Forgiveness, which is so easy for us to accept, cost the agony at Calvary. We should never take the forgiveness of sin, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and our sanctification in simple faith, and then forget the enormous cost to God that made all of this ours.Forgiveness is the divine miracle of grace. The cost to God was the Cross of Christ. To forgive sin, while remaining a holy God, this price had to be paid. Never accept a view of the fatherhood of God if it blots out the atonement. The revealed truth of God is that without the atonement He cannot forgive\u2014 He would contradict His nature if He did. The only way we can be forgiven is by being brought back to God through the atonement of the Cross. God\u2019s forgiveness is possible only in the supernatural realm.Compared with the miracle of the forgiveness of sin, the experience of sanctification is small. Sanctification is simply the wonderful expression or evidence of the forgiveness of sins in a human life.

The sensations coursed through his bones in great unrelenting waves. Elyon. How he was certain, he did not know. But he knew. Elyon was in this lake with him. Billos opened his eyes. Gold light drifted by. He lost all sense of direction. The water pressed in on every inch of his body, as intense as any acid, but one that burned with pleasure instead of pain. He sank into the water, opened his mouth and laughed. He wanted more, much more. He wanted to suck the water in and drink it. Without thinking, he did just that. The liquid hit his lungs. Billos pulled up, panicked. He tried to hack the water from his lungs, but inhaled more instead. No pain. He carefully sucked more water and breathed it out slowly. Then again, deep and hard. Out with a soft whoosh. He was breathing the water! Billos shrieked with laughter. He swam into the lake, deeper and deeper. The power contained in this lake was far greater than anything he'd ever imagined. \"I made this, Billos.\" Billos whipped his body around, searching for the words' source. \"Elyon?\" His voice was muffled, hardly a voice at all. \"Do you like it?\" \"Yes!\" Billos said. He might have spoken; he might have shouted--he didn't know. He only knew that his whole body screamed it.  Billos looked around. \"Elyon?\" \"Why do you doubt me, Billos?\" In that single moment the full weight of Billos's foolishness crashed on him like a sledgehammer. \"I see you, Billos.\" \"I made you.\" \"I love you.\" The words crashed over him, reaching into the deepest folds of his flesh, caressing each hidden synapse, flowing through every vein, as though he had been given a transfusion. \"I choose you, Billos.\" Billos began to weep. The feeling was more intense than any pain he had ever felt. The current pulled at him, tugging him up through the colors. His body trembled with pleasure. He wanted to speak, to yell, to tell the whole world that he was the most fortunate person in the universe. That he was loved by Elyon. Elyon himself. \"Never leave me, Billos.\" \"Never! I will never leave you.\" The current pushed him through the water and then above the surface not ten meters from the shore. He stood on the sandy bottom.

After all, if my survivability depends on a relation to others, to a \"you\" or a set of \"yous\" without whom I cannot exist, then my existence is not mine alone, but is to be found outside myself, in this set of relations that precede and exceed the boundaries of who I am. If I have a boundary at all, or if a boundary can be said to belong to me, it is only because I have become separated from others, and it is only on condition of this separation that I can relate to them at all. So the boundary is a function of the relation, a brokering of difference, a negotiation in which I am bound to you in my separateness. If I seek to preserve your life, it is not only because I seek to preserve my own, but because who \"I\" am is nothing without your life, and life itself has to be rethought as this complex, passionate, antagonistic, and necessary set of relations to others. I may lose this \"you\" and any number of particular others, and I may well survive those losses. But that can happen only if I do not lose the possibility of any \"you\" at all.
