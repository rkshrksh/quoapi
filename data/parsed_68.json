By his admirers, he was considered a great Latin American intellectual, and his newspaper Patria became the voice of \u201cCuban Independence.\u201d After years of suppression, the Cuban struggle for independence began in 1868. At the age of 17, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed was jailed in Cuba and then exiled to Spain because of his revolutionary activities. It was during this time in his life that he published a pamphlet describing the atrocities he had experienced while being imprisoned in Cuba. He strongly believed in racial equality and denounced the horrors of people having to live under a dictatorship.In 1878, Mart\u00ed was allowed to return to Cuba under a general amnesty, but was once again banished from Cuba after being accused of conspiracy against the Spanish authorities. From 1881 to 1895, he lived and worked in New York City. Moving to Florida, he organized forces for a three-pronged attack supporting the smoldering Cuban War of Independence. It was during one of the first battles that he was killed at the Battle of Dos R\u00edos in Cuba, and thus became a national hero and martyr when he was only 42 years old.", "author": "Captain Hank Bracker, \"Seawater One....\"", "tags": "cuban-history, cuban-revolution, inspirational-life"}, {"quote": "Convince yourself that you are capable to take the actions to change your life.

It was as if he wasn't truly listening to the strongest words, but to the heavy negativity that kept drowning him in his fear. His steps slowed down even further. He cried some more and was shaken even more by the unknown that was ahead. It was that he didn't want to take a chance of what could come ahead, what could be the most enlightening and most life changing steps he could take to better himself in the future.His family still stood behind him with every step he took. Every time he looked back it was getting dimmer and dimmer, but they were still there. They spoke softly to him, \"Everybody has risks in their lives, even obstacles they must over come. It will only make you stronger in the end, without risks in life, there is no chance.\"He didn't hear them speak; he heard it as if it was another language, something so far from understanding.The man found a bench and sat down.

Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness.Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders; but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul.Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob\u2026 and to stand and fight if he thinks he\u2019s right.Treat him gently; but do not cuddle him because only the test of fire makes fine steel.Let him have the courage to be impatient, let him have the patience to be brave.

And when everyone else sees everything in the world in a new way, the world will be changed and then mankind will turn their faces to the heavens in search of a brand new vision and then it will be able to see the heavens for what the heavens really are! That being because, in order for a person to change how he sees the world, he must first change the eyes of his soul and it is with those new eyes that man can look at the sun, that man can see the heavens, that man can know God.

However, I have come to learn at this time in my life, that such an attitude is all good for a while, but then there does come a point where you must see and identify yourself; also see and identify others! You have to be able to identify yourself as someone who is made happy by this and as someone who doesn't like that; then when you meet people, discern if those same things are the things that make them happy and if those same things are the things that they don't like, because at a point in time it becomes beneficial to you, to not waste time on blending in behalf of virtue but rather it becomes beneficial to you, to see yourself and go into the direction that makes you happy, taking people with you that are already going in that same direction and who also do not like the things that you do not like.

Not even the Sun. Not even the Earth. Not even the universeEveryone will have to embrace their eternal sleep someday. It can happen anytime. Anywhere. And at any location.It is Sudden.Many people die filled with regret.Regret that they didn't get their dream job.Regret that they didn't listen to their parents.Regret that they didn't confide to their crush.Regret that they didn't get into a better high school.But most of all, they regret that they haven't live life to it's fullest.That they didn't try out everything in the world. That they didn't get to see much of it.Few people die with happiness.It is because they have seen everything.It is because they have travelled to nearly every place on Earth.It is because they have done good in the world.It is because they know that they have enjoyed life and have made Earth a more enjoyable place for future generations.Those people that die with no regrets have chosen a better path. They pursued their dreams.They followed it.They completed it.And they accomplished it.Those people are worth following. Those people are worth remembering.So let's remember them.And never forget the good things that they have left in this world.", "author": "Hina Yu", "tags": "do-the-right-thing, don-t-die-with-regret, dream, fight-for-it, reach-your-goals, stay-hopeful"}, {"quote": "As a human I'm complex, as a human I don't have limits, but the book have it's own limits.
