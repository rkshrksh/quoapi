I wandered in the warm streets of a port, in the low quarter of some Barcelona or Marseille. The streets were noisome, with their freshly-heaped piles of ordure outside the doors, in the blue shadows of their high roofs. They all led down towards the sea. The gold-spangled sea, seeming as if it had been polished by the sun, could be seen at the end of each thoroughfare, bristling with yard-arms and luminous masts. The implacable blue of the sky shone brilliantly overhead as I wandered through the long, cool and sombre corridors in the emptiness of a deserted district: a quarter which might almost have been dead, abruptly abandoned by seamen and foreigners. I was alone, subjected to the stares of prostitutes seated at their windows or in the doorways, whose eyes seemed to ransack my very soul.They did not speak to me. Leaning on the sides of tall bay-windows or huddled in doorways, they were silent. Their breasts and arms were bare, bizarrely made up in pink, their eyebrows were darkened, they wore their hair in corkscrew-curls, decorated with paper flowers and metal birds. And they were all exactly alike!They might have been huge marionettes, or tall mannequin dolls left behind in panic - for I divined that some plague, some frightful epidemic brought from the Orient by sailors, had swept through the town and emptied it of its inhabitants. I was alone with these simulacra of love, abandoned by the men on the doorsteps of the brothels.I had already been wandering for hours without being able to find a way out of that miserable quarter, obsessed by the fixed and varnished eyes of all those automata, when I was seized by the sudden thought that all these girls were dead, plague-stricken and putrefied by cholera where they stood, in the solitude, beneath their carmine plaster masks... and my entrails were liquefied by cold. In spite of that harrowing chill, I was drawn closer to a motionless girl. I saw that she was indeed wearing a mask... and the girl in the next doorway was also masked... and all of them were horribly alike under their identical crude colouring...I was alone with the masks, with the masked corpses, worse than the masks... when, all of a sudden, I perceived that beneath the false faces of plaster and cardboard, the eyes of these dead women were alive.Their vitreous eyes were looking at me...I woke up with a cry, for in that moment I had recognised all the women. They all had the eyes of Kranile and Willie, of Willie the mime and Kranile the dancer. Every one of the dead women had Kranile's left eye and Willie's right eye... so that every one of them appeared to be squinting.Am I to be haunted by masks now?", "author": "Jean Lorrain, Monsieur De Phocas", "tags": "automata, cholera, dead, death, decadence, dream, mannequin, mannequins, marionettes, mask, masks, nightmare, plague, prostitutes, puppets, town"}, {"quote": "When a fairy tale ends a new one starts.

One night, when he was thinking of this, he suddenly found himself in a beautiful country, where the light did not come from sun or moon or stars, but floated round and over and in everything like the atmosphere. On all sides he heard mysterious melodies sung by strangely musical voices. None of the features of the landscape was definite; yet when he looked on the vague harmonies of colour that melted one into another before his sight he was filled with a sense of inexplicable beauty. On every side of him fluttered radiant bodies, which darted to and fro through the illuminated space. They were not birds, yet they flew like birds; and as each one crossed the path of his vision he felt a strange delight flash through his brain, and straightaway an interior voice seemed to sing beneath the vaulted dome of his temples a verse containing some beautiful thought. Little fairies were all this time dancing and fluttering around him, perching on his head, on his shoulders, or balancing themselves on his fingertips. 'Where am I?' he asked. 'Ah, Solon?' he heard them whisper, in tones that sounded like the distant tinkling of silver bells, \"this land is nameless; but those who tread its soil, and breathe its air, and gaze on its floating sparks of light, are poets forevermore.' Having said this, they vanished, and with them the beautiful indefinite land, and the flashing lights, and the illumined air; and the hunchback found himself again in bed, with the moonlight quivering on the floor, and the dusty books on their shelves, grim and mouldy as ever.'(\"The Wondersmith\")", "author": "Fitz-James O'Brien, Terror by Gaslight: More Victorian Tales of Terror", "tags": "dream, fairyland, fantastique, poet, poetry, vision"}, {"quote": "Alexei was a dream of something more...

Well crafted, obviously, with intricately carved woodwork edges and a perfectly painted face, but just a clock.But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else.The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side. Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully.All of this takes hours.The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played.At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dress in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern.After midnight, the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the cloud returns.

She would start proofing it tomorrow after she\u2019d given her brain a break. Now she\u2019d do what she always did when she finished a book, or reached a good stopping point in one. Clean house. Check her backlog of emails. Pick up some more groceries. And take a run on the wolf side.She finished vacuuming and dusting, swearing every window must let all the outdoors in, and then started a batch of gingerbread cookie cutouts to celebrate finishing another book and the Christmas holiday season. While they were baking, she finally settled down to check her emails. Fan mail always came first, and one from her website got her attention right off. She opened it up and read: Hello, I\u2019m Owen Nottingham, private investigator for White River Investigations, White River Falls, Minnesota and my client, Strom Hart, hired me to locate you. Your parents, John and Cynthia Hart, left you an inheritance and you need to see the lawyer about it so that you can claim it. I need to verify that you are the right woman first. Is there any way that we can possibly meet and get this taken care of so you can collect your inheritance? Strom Hart will be the one to receive it by the end of the month otherwise. His assistant, Jim Winchester, said Mr. Hart is your uncle.\u201dShe reread the message again, not believing her eyes, tears filling them. She quickly looked at the date of the message. Two days ago! She knew she shouldn\u2019t have neglected her emails, but when she was into the story, she couldn\u2019t break away.She ground her teeth, raised her fingers to respond, and heard a knocking at her door. No one came here. Never. Ever. Not even salesmen.She glanced at her phases-of-the moon calendar. The waxing gibbous was just beginning. She should be fine. Just to be on the safe side, in case the person at the door was trouble, she pulled a can of mace from her desk drawer and headed for the door. She peered through the peephole. A handsome black-haired man waited at the door, with rugged features and intense blue eyes. He was dressed in a black suit, a red shirt, and a dark purple tie covered in red, purple, and gold Christmas balls. She raised her brows.\u201cI\u2019m Owen Nottingham,\u201d he said to the door, holding up his PI license and driver\u2019s license. He couldn\u2019t know that she was watching him, so he must have hoped she was there, observing him. \u201cI tried getting hold of you on your contact form on your website about your inheritance. Your contact form might not be working, so I had to locate you in person.\u201dSo this was the man who had sent the message. But was he for real? He had to be. He wouldn\u2019t have come all this way to see her if he wasn\u2019t. But how had he found her? She opened the door, the bells jingling on her Christmas wreath, and he glanced down at the can of mace in her hand. He smiled, his gaze holding hers with such intensity, it was as though he could see clear through to her soul. \u201cReally, just a PI doing my job.\u201dA chilly breeze carried his scent to her. Wolf scent. She felt so lightheaded all at once, she grabbed the door to keep herself upright, and dropped the can of mace on the tile floor. It clattered, but she couldn\u2019t reach for it if her life depended on it. Oh. My. God.This couldn\u2019t be real. He couldn\u2019t be real. No wonder he was talking to the door. He must have heard her footfalls as she\u2019d approached.He took a deep breath at the same time and his eyes widened in surprise when he smelled her scent. His hand shot out to grab her arm and steady her. For a minute, as she tried to control her breathing, her heart rate, neither of which she could steady. She felt like she was going to pass out.\u201cHell, you\u2019re the wolf I saw across the White River, aren\u2019t you?", "author": "Terry Spear, Dreaming of a White Wolf Christmas", "tags": "christmas-romance, holiday-romance, paranormal-romance, shifter-romance"}, {"quote": "Owen couldn\u2019t believe his luck.

After the initial shock of seeing an unfamiliar and intriguing Arctic she-wolf, he\u2019d gone after her.The whole pack had gone on a run that night, but they knew to stay far away from any campsite. He and the other guys had swum across the river to explore a bit. Cameron and his mate had stayed on the other side with the kids. He\u2019d even swum back across the river to find her and discovered her scent had led right to one of the tents. Since she had moved into the tent, he knew she had to be one of their shifter kind. He\u2019d even hung around the next day, waiting to catch a glimpse of her, but there were several women, and he had no idea which one had been her. Two blonds, a couple of brunettes, and a red-haired woman\u2014none of whom looked like the picture he had of Clara Hart, though.Being a white wolf in summer had made it difficult to blend in, so he\u2019d had to keep well out of sight.Candice Mayfair was definitely the author of the books on the website, though she didn\u2019t look like the photo her uncle had of her, if she was Clara Hart.

The army wasn\u2019t the kind of job where you could walk into the boss\u2019s office and say, \u201cI quit.\u201dThinking it would be a good idea to steer the conversation back to safer ground, he reached for another fajita and asked Minka a question instead. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll work on next with Ivy and Tanner? You going to practice with the claws for a while or move on to something else?\u201dAngelo felt a little crappy about changing the subject, but if Minka noticed, she didn\u2019t seem to mind. And it wasn\u2019t like he had to fake interest in what she was saying. Anything that involved Minka was important to him. Besides, he didn\u2019t know much about shifters or hybrids, so the whole thing was pretty damn fascinating.\u201cWhat do you visualize when you see the beast in your mind?\u201d he asked.\u201cBefore today, I thought of it as a giant, blurry monster. But after learning that the beast is a cat, that\u2019s how I picture it now.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot a little house cat, of course. They aren\u2019t scary enough. More like a big cat that roams the mountains.\u201d \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said. Minka set the other half of her fourth fajita on her plate and gave him a curious look. \u201cWould you mind if I ask you a personal question?\u201dHis mouth twitched as he prepared another fajita. He wasn\u2019t used to Minka being so reserved. She usually said whatever was on her mind, regardless of whether it was personal or not.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said.\u201cThe first time we met, I had claws, fangs, glowing red eyes, and I tried to kill you. Since then, I\u2019ve spent most of the time telling you about an imaginary creature that lives inside my head and makes me act like a monster. How are you so calm about that? Most people would have run away already.\u201dAngelo chuckled. Not exactly the personal question he\u2019d expected, but then again Minka rarely did the expected.\u201cWell, my mom was full-blooded Cherokee, and I grew up around all kinds of Indian folktales and legends. My dad was in the army, and whenever he was deployed, Mom would take my sisters and me back to the reservation where she grew up in Oklahoma. I\u2019d stay up half the night listening to the old men tell stories about shape-shifters, animal spirits, skin-walkers, and trickster spirits.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I necessarily believed in all that stuff back then, but after meeting Ivy, Tanner, and the other shifters at the DCO, it just didn\u2019t faze me that much.\u201d Minka looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a real American Indian? Like in the movies? With horses and everything?\u201dHe laughed again. The expression of wonder on her face was adorable. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m only half-Indian. My dad is Mexican, so there\u2019s that. And second, Native Americans are almost nothing like you see in the movies. We don\u2019t all live in tepees and ride horses. In fact, I don\u2019t even own a horse.\u201d Minka was a little disappointed about the no-horse thing, but she was fascinated with what it was like growing up on an Indian reservation and being surrounded by all those legends. She immediately asked him to tell her some Indian stories. It had been a long time since he\u2019d thought about them, but to make her happy, he dug through his head and tried to remember every tale he\u2019d heard as a kid.", "author": "Paige Tyler, Her Fierce Warrior", "tags": "paranormal-romance"}, {"quote": "Do you have any idea how maddening it's been envisioning you in the lingerie that matches those shoes?\"...\t\"Corbin, I'm serious.\"\t\"I'm sure you are but that is my final offer.

Every King had been woken to take part. After all the wars they had been involved in, Arian wasn\u2019t happy to be woken to join another.Because of Ulrik. The banished and disgraced Dragon King hadn\u2019t just made a nuisance of himself, but he somehow managed to get his magic returned.Which meant the Kings needed to put extra magic into keeping the four silver dragons sleeping undisturbed deep within the mountain. They were Ulrik\u2019s dragons, and he would want to wake them soon.But it wasn\u2019t just Ulrik that was causing mischief. The Dark Fae were as well. It infuriated Arian that they were once more fighting the Dark. Hadn\u2019t the Fae Wars killed enough Fae and dragons?Then again, as a Dragon King as old as time itself, they were targets for others who wanted to defeat them.For Ulrik, he just wanted revenge. Arian hated him for it, but he could understand. Mostly because Arian had briefly joined Ulrik in his quest to rid the realm of humans.Thoughts of Ulrik were pushed aside as Arian found himself thinking about why he had taken to his mountain.

Some were just tired of dealing with mortals, but others had something they wished to forget for a while.

The one that sent him to his mountain still preyed upon him.He didn\u2019t remember her name, but he remembered her tears. Because of the spell to prevent any of the Dragon Kings from falling in love with mortals, Arian had easily walked away from the female.Six centuries later, he could still hear her begging him to stay with her, still see the tears coursing down her face. Though he hadn\u2019t felt anything, it bothered him that he had so easily walked away. Because Con had demanded it.Loyalty\u2014above all else.The Dragon Kings were his family, and Dreagan his home.

Thus, to me he's a photograph; a story I heard my grandfather tell. He's not a life I remember. And my children may not know him at all, unless by chance they can find him in a book. In time, he will be forgotten entirely, just as we all will with enough revolutions of the earth around the slowly expiring sun. Each fragile heart now beating will one day stop ...
